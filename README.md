# Pilot

**Pilot** is your self-hosted, privacy-first coding assistant for Visual Studio Code. It brings AI-powered chat and inline code completions right into your editor‚Äîhelping you code, debug, and explore your project faster. Best of all, your code stays yours‚Äîno data ever leaves your machine.

# Features

- ‚ú® Inline Code Completions
  Get real-time suggestions based on your code context, powered by your own models.

- üí¨ Chat with AI
  Ask questions, get explanations, or debug problems using a smart developer assistant.

- üìÅ Workspace Indexing
  Boost accuracy by indexing your project so the assistant understands your codebase better.

- üß† Customizable System Prompts
  Tune how Pilot behaves, both in completions and chat.

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcuts**

  - Ctrl+Shift+Space / Cmd+Shift+Space: Rerun inline completion

  - Ctrl+Alt+P / Cmd+Alt+P: Open chat

  - Ctrl+Alt+I / Cmd+Alt+I: Index workspace

## Requirements

To use Pilot, you must run a local or remote Ollama server with 2 types of models, a normal LLM for coding and an Embedding LLM for indexing.

The ones I recommend are:

- **codellama:instruct (for inline completion and chatting)**

- **nomic-embed-text:latest (for embedding workspace context)**

You can also use other models.

Install them with:

```bash
ollama pull codellama:instruct
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:instruct
```

Then, set the server URL and model names in your VS Code settings.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up**: If your machine isn‚Äôt powerful enough to run these models smoothly, you may notice delays during chat, completion, or indexing
